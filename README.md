# celeba_stargan
Stargan for CelebA. A Deep Learning practical

Keras implementation based on 
https://github.com/taki0112/StarGAN-Tensorflow

# Notes:

# Todo:
* Implement loss functions
* Layers:
    * Check wether they place correctly
    * adapt label image tensorboard output to be more clear
* Simplify build_model function
* Simplify learn function
* Model restory points
* Validate on validation set
